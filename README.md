# Curry
Curry is a currency conversion library for Android. It's build on top of [exchangeratesapi](https://exchangeratesapi.io/).
Which is a free API for current and historical foreign exchange rates published by the European Central Bank.
The rates are updated daily around 4PM CET every working day. 

## Download
### Gradle
Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
Add the dependency
```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.roadmaptravel:Curry:0.1.5'
}

```

## Usage

This library makes use of RxAndroid for its calls.

```kotlin
CurryApiClient(this).service.getLatestRates()
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.computation())
                .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
                .subscribe(object : SingleObserver<ForExRates> {
                    override fun onError(e: Throwable) {
                        Log.w("DEBUG", e.toString())
                    }

                    override fun onSuccess(t: ForExRates) {
                        Log.d("DEBUG", t.toString())
                    }

                    override fun onSubscribe(d: Disposable) {
                    }

                })
```

**`getLatest(currencyCode: String)`** returns an `Single` which emits the `ForExRates` data. The data contains the latest foreign exchange reference rates.

**`getHistoricalRates(date: String)`** returns an `Single` which emits the `ForExRates` data. The data contains rates for any day since 1999. Choose a day by setting the `date` in your request. The format is `2000-01-03`.

**`getSpecificRates(symbols: String)`** returns an `Single` which emits the `ForExRates` data. The data contains the latest foreign exchange reference rates for the chosen `symbols`. 


All rates are quoted against the Euro by default. Quote against a different currency by setting the base `currencyCode` as a second parameter. 
e.g. ```getHistoricalRates("2000-01-03", "USD") ```
All currency codes are int the [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) format.
